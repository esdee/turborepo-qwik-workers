What I'm trying to achieve with this repo:

1. Monorepo using Turborepo +
2. Cloudflare worker as an API server using D1, KV, access to env vars +
3. Qwik Pages web front-end deployed as Cloudflare Pages, uses API server mentioned in 1
4. Shared libaries for use across the Monorepo, within the /packages folder +
5. Tests
6. Deploy via Github Actions +
7. Typescript for everything
8. Good DX with Linting, pre-commit hooks e.t.c.
9. tRPC for API server and web front-end communication
